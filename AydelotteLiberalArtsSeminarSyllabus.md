## The Aydelotte Foundation Seminar in the Liberal Arts
### Swarthmore College
### Professor Burke, Professor Buurma
### Spring 2018
### M 1:15-3:50
### Office hours: W 1-3, Parrish W201

The Aydelotte Foundation is an internal Swarthmore research institute dedicated to investigating the meanings and uses of the concept of “liberal arts” and the practices that institutions and individuals follow in the name of that concept. Starting in the spring of 2018, the Foundation will be offering an annual course that examines the history and structure of liberal education. We will regularly use Swarthmore as an example but are not limited to it in the scope of the class. In the second part of the course, we will study the specific operations of key components of liberal education, drawing on the expertise of faculty and staff at Swarthmore. This first iteration of the class focuses around perceived oppositions and practical continuities between “vocation” and “liberal arts” education.

## Introduction

tension play out in your own life? Let’s generate keywords in this discourse: vocation, jobs, careers, practicality, outcomes, earning potential, ineffable, intangible

## Assignments

### Response papers
You will write three 1000-word informal response papers over the course of the semester; they are due by 5 pm on Sunday before class. They can be structured to make an argument or to offer a series of observations and questions that you then provide some analysis or answer to.

### Microflection
Pick a quotation from a reading each week that you think is especially provocative, discussable and shareable with any public interested in liberal education. Write 2-3 sentences about why you found this interesting, and have what you write be something you’d be comfortable having shared in social media.

### Reading summaries
You will write three 500-word  summaries of readings; like the seminar papers and close readings, they are due by 5 pm Sunday before class. These should usually include a brief paragraph on the main claim and stakes of the reading, a more detailed overview of the argument, a note if relevant on the writer’s style, feeling, and tone, and particular mention (with page numbers) of points/passages you think are especially important for our purposes
and/or require our critique.

### Building/rebuilding/critiquing the syllabus
4 times this semester (Week 2, Week 6, Week 9, Week 10), in preparing for class, we will ask you to search in Tripod, WorldCat, Google, or other discovery space, regarding the theme or topics for that week. What is not in the syllabus that could be, in terms of those themes and topics? Is the discourse or conversation as it appears on the syllabus really as sociologically limited (or diverse) as it seems? Are there ways to think about the topic for the week that locates the main conversation in other communities or with other voices? E.g., for Week 2, why is a lot of the concern for “liberal arts” connected to older white men who have access to a certain kind of formal public sphere (newspapers, the Atlantic Monthly, the Chronicle of Higher Education, etc.)

### Final projects
Our final projects will center around the idea of honors work in general and Swarthmore’s Honors program in specific.

### Accommodations for disability
We want to work to make sure that everyone in this class has the access to the materials, resources, and support they need in order to learn most effectively. You are always free to talk to either of us about your own situation.  A key Swarthmore resource in this area is the Office of Student Disability Services. Their accommodations policy is here:

> If you believe that you need accommodations for a disability, if you are a student and your last name starts with letters A through M, please contact Erin Leuthold eleutho1@swarthmore.edu. If you are a student and your last name starts with letters N through Z, please contact Jenna Rose jrose2@swarthmore.edu. You can also reach them by emailing studentdisabilityservices@swarthmore.edu or contacting Administrative Assistant Diane Watson (Parrish West 119, dwatson1@swarthmore.edu). As appropriate, they will issue students with documented disabilities a formal Accommodations Letter. Since accommodations require early planning and are not retroactive, please contact them as soon as possible. For details about the accommodations process, visit the Student Disability Service Website at
http://www.swarthmore.edu/academic-advising-support/welcome-to-student-disability-service

You are also welcome to contact us privately to discuss your academic needs. However, all disability-related accommodations must be arranged through the Office of
Student Disability Services.

### Dean's Discretionary Fund and Dean's Office resources for basic needs

If purchasing your textbooks or other materials for this or any other class present a serious financial difficulty for you, you should be aware of the [Dean's Discretionary Fund](http://www.swarthmore.edu/student-life/deans-discretionary-funding-request-guidelines) and other resources such as the Course Book Collection in Underhill Library in Lang Music.

The Dean's Office describes the fund this way:

> The spirit of this funding is primarily to support emergency circumstances and priority is given to students in the highest financial need tiers.  Funding is usually limited to under $500 and most grants are under $300.  Please note the Dean's Office may not be able to fulfill all requests.

> Examples of eligible non-academic requests include, but are not limited to, expenses associated with emergency medical, dental, vision procedures, unanticipated trips home due to a family emergency, and various fees related to postgraduate opportunities.

The Student Life office at Swarthmore is very committed to making sure that all students having living situations that support their ability to work and live here successfully. If you find that you are having sustained difficulties with your food or housing situation and believe that this may affect your course performance, you should contact your class dean; you are also free to contact me if you wish so that I can help you find the support you need.

### Plagiarism
Plagiarism is a very serious offense. It includes both the direct copying of the words of another person without crediting him or her and paraphrasing the ideas of another person without giving credit. If you have any questions about how to properly cite another person’s work, please do not hesitate to ask me. Some of our work is collaborative, or may be circulated in public, so always ask if you have any concerns.

### Attendance and due dates
Because this is a seminar, attendance is essential. Missing class (except for cases of illness or true emergencies) is inadvisable. However, if you are really ill, try to contact us ahead of time, but do plan to miss class!

### Your Own Devices Policy
Because our class is intensively collaborative, we will expect that you will be focused on the texts and on your classmates. If it is your experience that having a screen in front of you can distract you from the work of being in class, please take measures to prevent such self-distraction.

### Syllabus

This syllabus is necessarily an incomplete document; we will revise and save versions of it as the class progresses.
